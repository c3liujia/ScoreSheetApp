# Online Scoresheet App

This app is electronic replica of the scoresheet used in many Junior leagues that follow the FIBA system. It was templated after a sheet I used in scorekeeping Ontario Basketball Association Games as of 2016.

## How to use


#### Edit Fields

Most empty "boxes" on the sheet are input fields. The lines in the right section reserved for game/tournament info are also input fields. Just click on them and start typing. The following are examples on how updating certain fields look:

```
Team name, team color, player name, player number
```

```
For equal participation, the boxes toggles as they are clicked
```

```
For fouls, the boxes toggles to a grey box with the quarter 
number when they were clicked. The quarter team fouls are
automatically updated (and with current FIBA system, 
maxes out at 4).
```

```
To change the quarter, hover mouse over the widget on the 
top-right of the screen. The widget gets focused.
```

```
This will affect the fouls when they are clicked
```

```
When a player scores, click on the box corresponding to 
the quarter they scored and a menu will pop up. Select 
the amount scored (choose '1' if it is a free throw).
```
![Player Scores](https://github.com/c3liujia/ScoreSheetApp/blob/master/src/media/Screenshots/pic06.png)

```
Notice the team score gets automatically updated
```
![Player Scores](https://github.com/c3liujia/ScoreSheetApp/blob/master/src/media/Screenshots/pic07.png)

```
This can be done for different quarters. The player 
total column also gets summed up.
```

```
To remove a score, click on the number and a menu will pop up. 
Upon removal, team score automatically updates
```
![Remove Score](https://github.com/c3liujia/ScoreSheetApp/blob/master/src/media/Screenshots/pic09.png)

```
Time outs are also toggles. Additional blank boxes can be used 
for overtime timeouts
```

Coach name can be typed in. The signature box is meant for coach 
agreement to game rules (Not implemented yet)

## Future plans

Currently, the app is only a static front-end application. Future plans include:
* Generate links for users to download the sheet
* Allow users to log-in and fill out their team info ahead of time
* Logo uploading

Any concerns or suggestions are welcomed at my email henry_liu25@hotmail.com.
